# Python-While-Loop

Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

example:

number = 100

while number > 0:

    print(number)
    
    number //= 2


output:
100
50
25
12
6
3
1
